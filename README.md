# SnakeGame
Using Python and the pygame library, I made the famous Snake game by following along a youtube video by Clear Code! During this 2 hour long walkthrough video, there are multiple challenges such as trying to come up with a solution on your own, and I found that to be incredibly rewarding and fun to try.
